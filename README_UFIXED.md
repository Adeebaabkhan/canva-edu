cp ufixed.py /your/project/directory/
```

### Full Installation with Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies for full functionality
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- **Required**: None (works with Python 3.7+ standard library)
- **Recommended**: 
  - `Pillow` - Advanced image processing
  - `reportlab` - PDF generation
  - `qrcode` - QR code generation
  - `requests` - Improved HTTP handling

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from ufixed import create_sample_student, ReceiptGenerator, IDCardGenerator

# Create student record
student = create_sample_student('USA')

# Generate receipt
receipt_gen = ReceiptGenerator()
pdf_receipt = receipt_gen.generate_receipt(student, 'PDF')

# Generate ID card
id_gen = IDCardGenerator()
id_card = id_gen.generate_id_card(student, template='modern')
```

### Batch Processing
```python
from ufixed import BatchProcessor, create_sample_student

# Create multiple students
students = [
    create_sample_student('USA'),
    create_sample_student('India'),
    create_sample_student('UK')
]

# Process batch
processor = BatchProcessor()
results = processor.process_batch(students, operations=['receipt', 'id_card'])

print(f"Processed: {results['processed']}")
print(f"Files generated: {len(results['files'])}")
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run with default settings
python ufixed.py

# This will:
# 1. Create sample students from different countries
# 2. Generate receipts and ID cards
# 3. Save files to 'output' directory
# 4. Show progress and results
```
